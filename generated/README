A directory containing files that can be re-generated but that are currently
under version control because they take a while to re-generate.

- [help.cache] can be regenerated with the [updatehelp] command of [nodeclient/client.js]
- [langs] can be regenerated with the [updatelang] command of [nodeclient/client.js]

Running [jake update-docs] will perform both of the tasks above.
